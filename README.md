# QA SQL Lab

SQL learning repository focused on QA Engineering and PostgreSQL database validation practice.

## Purpose

This project is a small hands-on lab for learning SQL through realistic QA scenarios. It uses an e-commerce style dataset with users, addresses, orders, and payments.

The sample data includes both valid rows and intentional data quality problems, such as duplicate emails, orphan records, missing values, and invalid amounts.

## Structure

```text
datasets/
  reset.sql       -- drop lab views and tables
  schema.sql      -- create PostgreSQL tables
  seed_data.sql   -- insert sample data
  views.sql       -- create reusable QA views

tests/
  run_all.sql             -- complete PostgreSQL test runner
  data_contract.sql       -- sample data expectations

## How to Run

From a PostgreSQL database:

```bash
psql -d qa-sql-lab -f datasets/reset.sql
psql -d qa-sql-lab -f datasets/schema.sql
psql -d qa-sql-lab -f datasets/seed_data.sql
psql -d qa-sql-lab -f datasets/views.sql
```

Then run examples or validation checks:

```bash
psql -d qa-sql-lab -f queries/qa_validation_queries.sql
```

## Automated Validation

Run the complete test suite against an empty PostgreSQL database:

```bash
psql -d qa-sql-lab -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f tests/run_all.sql
```

The suite rebuilds the lab, checks expected data-quality scenarios and executes every query file. GitHub Actions runs the same suite for pushes and pull requests targeting `main`.

The hyphenated database name works directly with `psql`, `POSTGRES_DB`, and
`PGDATABASE`. When the name is used as an identifier inside a SQL statement,
quote it as `"qa-sql-lab"`.

GitLab CI runs the same PostgreSQL validation after changes reach the default
branch or a merge request. Both platforms use `tests/run_all.sql` as the single
test entry point.

## Data Quality Report

The `data_quality_rule_report` view provides a reusable baseline for known
training-data issues:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM data_quality_rule_report
ORDER BY severity, rule_id;
```

It distinguishes expected fixture counts from regressions and improvements.
See `docs/data_quality_baselines.md` for the rule format and extension workflow.
Completeness rules cover user ages and address postal codes.
Eligibility rules flag active users below the minimum account age.
Uniqueness rules cover user emails and order numbers.
Temporal rules detect deletion status/timestamp mismatches and impossible
creation, payment, and deletion event sequences.
Domain rules validate status and payment-method fields against approved values.
Relationship rules detect multiple primary addresses and address-country
mismatches.
Payment lifecycle rules flag shipped orders without successful payments,
cancelled orders without refunds, refunded payments on non-cancelled orders,
successful payments on non-payable orders, new or cancelled orders that still
have successful payments, refunded payments without timestamps, failed payments
with timestamps, and failed or pending payments on non-new orders. Pending
payments are expected to remain timestamp-free until settlement.
The `data_quality_rule_summary` view aggregates rule counts and deviations by
severity for faster triage.
The `payment_method_summary` view aggregates checkout coverage by payment
method and status.
The `country_user_order_summary` view compares user and order coverage by
country.
The `primary_address_coverage_summary` view shows primary address coverage by
country.
The `order_status_payment_summary` view compares payment coverage across order
statuses without double-counting orders that have multiple payment attempts.

## Schema Contracts

The test suite compares the live PostgreSQL schema with explicit contracts for
all 28 table columns, four primary keys, and four supporting indexes. This
catches missing or unexpected objects, type changes, nullability changes,
column reordering, primary key drift, and index definition drift.

Run `queries/schema_validation_queries.sql` to investigate differences. See
`docs/schema_contracts.md` for the migration workflow.
